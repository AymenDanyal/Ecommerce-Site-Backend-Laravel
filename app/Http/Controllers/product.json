Acute (short-term) inhalation of maleic anhydride has been observed to induce irritation of the respiratory tract and the eyes in people. It has been reported that chronic (long-term) exposure to maleic anhydride causes chronic bronchitis, asthma-like episodes, and irritation of the upper respiratory tract and eyes in workers. Some individuals have developed allergies to the point that they can no longer tolerate lesser dosages. Rats continuously gavage-exposed to maleic anhydride exhibited kidney dysfunction (experimentally placing the chemical in the stomach).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>USES AND APPLICATIONS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Synthetic resin raw material</li>\r\n\t<li>Paints and coatings</li>\r\n\t<li>Resin modifiers</li>\r\n\t<li>Vinyl chloride stabilizers</li>\r\n\t<li>Food additives</li>\r\n\t<li>Agricultural chemicals</li>\r\n\t<li>Paper sizing agents</li>\r\n\t<li>Surfactants</li>\r\n\t<li>Plasticizers (DOM, DBM, DEM)</li>\r\n\t<li>Other (GBL, 14BG, THF)</li>\r\n\t<li>Colorless or white crystalline solid</li>\r\n\t<li>Acrid (irritating, choking, and offensive) odor</li>\r\n\t<li>Readily soluble in water</li>\r\n\t<li>Molecular weight is 98.06 g/mol</li>\r\n\t<li>Vapor specific gravity is 3.4</li>\r\n\t<li>Can be harmful if swallowed</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",
